# Timed-Quiz
Created a quiz that will add 10 ponts for each question correct and subtract 10 second for each question wrong and will allow you to store your name and score at the end of the quiz. 

## what was done

creating multiple functions to execute each question as asked, set the answers to generate points while incorrect choices subtract from the time. Localstorage allows user to store score along with name, displays in console at the moment, needs to be fixed. Attempted for loop to generate each high score and name saved on quiz, error showing text.
